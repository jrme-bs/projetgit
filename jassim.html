            <h1>Jassim's Biography</h1>

            <p>
                Hello! My name is Jassim, and I was born on September 24, 2002, in Dar Bouazza, a charming coastal
                village near Casablanca, Morocco.
                From a young age, I have been fascinated by the world of science fiction, which has shaped many of my
                interests and aspirations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Dar Bouazza, located just 15 kilometers from the bustling city of Casablanca, offers a serene escape
                from the chaos of urban life.
                This picturesque village is a harmonious blend of tranquility and natural beauty, making it an inspiring
                place to grow up.

                I gained interest in science fiction due to games and movies, such as <em>Crysis 2</em> and
                <em>Akira</em>, which pushed me to explore this fascinating world even more!

            <p>
                In 2020, at just 17 years old (almost 18), I moved to Brest, France, to begin my studies. Initially, I
                had planned
                to study a different field, but somewhere mid-flight, I decided to pursue computer science instead! ðŸ˜‚
