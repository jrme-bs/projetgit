            <p>
                Hello! My name is Jassim, and I was born on September 24, 2002, in Dar Bouazza, a charming coastal
                village near Casablanca, Morocco.
                From a young age, I have been fascinated by the world of science fiction, which has shaped many of my
                interests and aspirations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Dar Bouazza, located just 15 kilometers from the bustling city of Casablanca, offers a serene escape
                from the chaos of urban life.
                This picturesque village is a harmonious blend of tranquility and natural beauty, making it an inspiring
                place to grow up.
            </p>
